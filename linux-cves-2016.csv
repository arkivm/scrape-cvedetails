CVE-2014-9803	2016-07-11	2016-07-12	9.3	0.11%			arch/arm64/include/asm/pgtable.h in the Linux kernel before 3.15-rc5-next-20140519, as used in Android before 2016-07-05 on Nexus 5X and 6P devices, mishandles execute-only pages, which allows attackers to gain privileges via a crafted application, aka Android internal bug 28557020.
CVE-2014-9717	2016-05-02	2016-08-12	6.1	0.04%			fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel before 4.0.2 processes MNT_DETACH umount2 system calls without verifying that the MNT_LOCKED flag is unset, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and navigate to filesystem locations beneath a mount by calling umount2 within a user namespace.
CVE-2014-9410	2016-08-07	2020-11-17	9.8	0.25%			The vfe31_proc_general function in drivers/media/video/msm/vfe/msm_vfe31.c in the MSM-VFE31 driver for the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, does not validate a certain id value, which allows attackers to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via an application that makes a crafted ioctl call.
CVE-2013-4312	2016-02-08	2023-02-13	6.2	0.15%			The Linux kernel before 4.4.1 allows local users to bypass file-descriptor limits and cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by sending each descriptor over a UNIX socket before closing it, related to net/unix/af_unix.c and net/unix/garbage.c.
CVE-2012-6704	2016-12-28	2023-01-17	7.8	0.04%			The sock_setsockopt function in net/core/sock.c in the Linux kernel before 3.5 mishandles negative values of sk_sndbuf and sk_rcvbuf, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability for a crafted setsockopt system call with the (1) SO_SNDBUF or (2) SO_RCVBUF option.
CVE-2012-6703	2016-06-29	2023-01-17	7.8	0.04%			Integer overflow in the snd_compr_allocate_buffer function in sound/core/compress_offload.c in the ALSA subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.6-rc6-next-20120917 allows local users to cause a denial of service (insufficient memory allocation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted SNDRV_COMPRESS_SET_PARAMS ioctl call.
CVE-2012-6701	2016-05-02	2023-01-17	7.8	0.04%			Integer overflow in fs/aio.c in the Linux kernel before 3.4.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a large AIO iovec.
CVE-2012-6689	2016-05-02	2023-01-20	7.8	0.04%			The netlink_sendmsg function in net/netlink/af_netlink.c in the Linux kernel before 3.5.5 does not validate the dst_pid field, which allows local users to have an unspecified impact by spoofing Netlink messages.
CVE-2011-5321	2016-05-02	2018-01-05	5.5	0.04%			The tty_open function in drivers/tty/tty_io.c in the Linux kernel before 3.1.1 mishandles a driver-lookup failure, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted access to a device file under the /dev/pts directory.
CVE-2008-7316	2016-05-02	2016-05-06	5.5	0.04%			mm/filemap.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.25 allows local users to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a writev system call that triggers an iovec of zero length, followed by a page fault for an iovec of nonzero length.
CVE-2003-1604	2016-05-02	2016-12-01	7.8	0.78%			The redirect_target function in net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_REDIRECT.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) by sending packets to an interface that has a 0.0.0.0 IP address, a related issue to CVE-2015-8787.
