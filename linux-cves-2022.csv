CVE-2022-43945	2022-11-04	2023-03-08	7.5	0.05%			The Linux kernel NFSD implementation prior to versions 5.19.17 and 6.0.2 are vulnerable to buffer overflow. NFSD tracks the number of pages held by each NFSD thread by combining the receive and send buffers of a remote procedure call (RPC) into a single array of pages. A client can force the send buffer to shrink by sending an RPC message over TCP with garbage data added at the end of the message. The RPC message with garbage data is still correctly formed according to the specification and is passed forward to handlers. Vulnerable code in NFSD is not expecting the oversized request and writes beyond the allocated buffer space. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2022-3643	2022-12-07	2023-05-08	6.5	0.04%			Guests can trigger NIC interface reset/abort/crash via netback It is possible for a guest to trigger a NIC interface reset/abort/crash in a Linux based network backend by sending certain kinds of packets. It appears to be an (unwritten?) assumption in the rest of the Linux network stack that packet protocol headers are all contained within the linear section of the SKB and some NICs behave badly if this is not the case. This has been reported to occur with Cisco (enic) and Broadcom NetXtrem II BCM5780 (bnx2x) though it may be an issue with other NICs/drivers as well. In case the frontend is sending requests with split headers, netback will forward those violating above mentioned assumption to the networking core, resulting in said misbehavior.

CVE-2022-2991	2022-08-25	2022-08-30	6.7	0.05%			A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel's LightNVM subsystem. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. This vulnerability allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system to exploit this vulnerability.

CVE-2022-2503	2022-08-12	2023-02-14	6.9	0.04%			Dm-verity is used for extending root-of-trust to root filesystems. LoadPin builds on this property to restrict module/firmware loads to just the trusted root filesystem. Device-mapper table reloads currently allow users with root privileges to switch out the target with an equivalent dm-linear target and bypass verification till reboot. This allows root to bypass LoadPin and can be used to load untrusted and unverified kernel modules and firmware, which implies arbitrary kernel execution and persistence for peripherals that do not verify firmware updates.

There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default). Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time. (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing.

This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4.
CVE-2021-4037	2022-08-24	2022-12-08	7.8	0.05%			A vulnerability was found in the fs/inode.c:inode_init_owner() function logic of the LInux kernel that allows local users to create files for the XFS file-system with an unintended group ownership and with group execution and SGID permission bits set, in a scenario where a directory is SGID and belongs to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of this group. This can lead to excessive permissions granted in case when they should not. This vulnerability is similar to the previous CVE-2018-13405 and adds the missed fix for the XFS.

Given the ability to execute code, a local attacker could leverage this use-after-free to crash the system or possibly escalate privileges on the system.
CVE-2021-4023	2022-03-10	2022-03-15	5.5	0.04%			A flaw was found in the io-workqueue implementation in the Linux kernel versions prior to 5.15-rc1.

In this flaw, a local user with a special privilege (cap_sys_admin or cap_bpf) can modify the frozen mapped address space. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.16 rc2.
CVE-2021-3864	2022-08-26	2023-02-12	7.0	0.04%			A flaw was found in the way the dumpable flag setting was handled when certain SUID binaries executed its descendants. The prerequisite is a SUID binary that sets real UID equal to effective UID, and real GID equal to effective GID. The descendant will then have a dumpable value set to 1. As a result, if the descendant process crashes and core_pattern is set to a relative value, its core dump is stored in the current directory with uid:gid permissions. An unprivileged local user with eligible root SUID binary could use this flaw to place core dumps into root-owned directories, potentially resulting in escalation of privileges.
CVE-2021-3847	2022-04-01	2022-04-11	7.8	0.04%			An unauthorized access to the execution of the setuid file with capabilities flaw in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way user copying a capable file from a nosuid mount into another mount.

CVE-2021-3656	2022-03-04	2023-01-19	8.8	0.04%			A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the "virt_ext" field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS (Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape.
CVE-2021-3640	2022-03-03	2023-08-11	7.0	0.04%			A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del() together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page.
