CVE-2018-1000204	2018-06-26	2019-10-03	6.3	0.17%			** DISPUTED ** Linux Kernel version 3.18 to 4.16 incorrectly handles an SG_IO ioctl on /dev/sg0 with dxfer_direction=SG_DXFER_FROM_DEV and an empty 6-byte cmdp. This may lead to copying up to 1000 kernel heap pages to the userspace. This has been fixed upstream in https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/a45b599ad808c3c982fdcdc12b0b8611c2f92824 already. The problem has limited scope, as users don't usually have permissions to access SCSI devices. On the other hand, e.g. the Nero user manual suggests doing `chmod o+r+w /dev/sg*` to make the devices accessible. NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this report, noting that the requirement for an attacker to have both the CAP_SYS_ADMIN and CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities makes it "virtually impossible to exploit."
CVE-2018-1000200	2018-06-05	2018-10-31	5.5	0.06%			The Linux Kernel versions 4.14, 4.15, and 4.16 has a null pointer dereference which can result in an out of memory (OOM) killing of large mlocked processes. The issue arises from an oom killed process's final thread calling exit_mmap(), which calls munlock_vma_pages_all() for mlocked vmas.This can happen synchronously with the oom reaper's unmap_page_range() since the vma's VM_LOCKED bit is cleared before munlocking (to determine if any other vmas share the memory and are mlocked).
CVE-2018-1000199	2018-05-24	2020-08-24	5.5	0.04%			The Linux Kernel version 3.18 contains a dangerous feature vulnerability in modify_user_hw_breakpoint() that can result in crash and possibly memory corruption. This attack appear to be exploitable via local code execution and the ability to use ptrace. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in git commit f67b15037a7a50c57f72e69a6d59941ad90a0f0f.
CVE-2018-1000028	2018-02-09	2019-10-03	7.4	0.24%			Linux kernel version after commit bdcf0a423ea1 - 4.15-rc4+, 4.14.8+, 4.9.76+, 4.4.111+ contains a Incorrect Access Control vulnerability in NFS server (nfsd) that can result in remote users reading or writing files they should not be able to via NFS. This attack appear to be exploitable via NFS server must export a filesystem with the "rootsquash" options enabled. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in after commit 1995266727fa.
CVE-2018-1000026	2018-02-09	2020-10-15	7.7	0.26%			Linux Linux kernel version at least v4.8 onwards, probably well before contains a Insufficient input validation vulnerability in bnx2x network card driver that can result in DoS: Network card firmware assertion takes card off-line. This attack appear to be exploitable via An attacker on a must pass a very large, specially crafted packet to the bnx2x card. This can be done from an untrusted guest VM..
CVE-2018-1000004	2018-01-16	2020-07-15	7.1	0.82%			In the Linux kernel 4.12, 3.10, 2.6 and possibly earlier versions a race condition vulnerability exists in the sound system, this can lead to a deadlock and denial of service condition.
CVE-2018-20511	2018-12-27	2019-04-01	5.5	0.04%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.18.11. The ipddp_ioctl function in drivers/net/appletalk/ipddp.c allows local users to obtain sensitive kernel address information by leveraging CAP_NET_ADMIN to read the ipddp_route dev and next fields via an SIOCFINDIPDDPRT ioctl call.
CVE-2018-20169	2018-12-17	2019-08-13	7.2	0.20%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.19.9. The USB subsystem mishandles size checks during the reading of an extra descriptor, related to __usb_get_extra_descriptor in drivers/usb/core/usb.c.
CVE-2018-19854	2018-12-04	2019-11-06	4.7	0.05%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.19.3. crypto_report_one() and related functions in crypto/crypto_user.c (the crypto user configuration API) do not fully initialize structures that are copied to userspace, potentially leaking sensitive memory to user programs. NOTE: this is a CVE-2013-2547 regression but with easier exploitability because the attacker does not need a capability (however, the system must have the CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER kconfig option).
CVE-2018-19824	2018-12-03	2019-09-10	7.8	0.04%			In the Linux kernel through 4.19.6, a local user could exploit a use-after-free in the ALSA driver by supplying a malicious USB Sound device (with zero interfaces) that is mishandled in usb_audio_probe in sound/usb/card.c.
CVE-2018-19407	2018-11-21	2019-03-21	5.5	0.04%			The vcpu_scan_ioapic function in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.2 allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and BUG) via crafted system calls that reach a situation where ioapic is uninitialized.
CVE-2018-19406	2018-11-21	2018-12-19	5.5	0.04%			kvm_pv_send_ipi in arch/x86/kvm/lapic.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.2 allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and BUG) via crafted system calls that reach a situation where the apic map is uninitialized.
CVE-2018-18955	2018-11-16	2020-08-24	7.0	0.09%		Yes	In the Linux kernel 4.15.x through 4.19.x before 4.19.2, map_write() in kernel/user_namespace.c allows privilege escalation because it mishandles nested user namespaces with more than 5 UID or GID ranges. A user who has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in an affected user namespace can bypass access controls on resources outside the namespace, as demonstrated by reading /etc/shadow. This occurs because an ID transformation takes place properly for the namespaced-to-kernel direction but not for the kernel-to-namespaced direction.
CVE-2018-18710	2018-10-29	2019-04-03	5.5	0.04%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.19. An information leak in cdrom_ioctl_select_disc in drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c could be used by local attackers to read kernel memory because a cast from unsigned long to int interferes with bounds checking. This is similar to CVE-2018-10940 and CVE-2018-16658.
CVE-2018-18690	2018-10-26	2019-10-03	5.5	0.04%			In the Linux kernel before 4.17, a local attacker able to set attributes on an xfs filesystem could make this filesystem non-operational until the next mount by triggering an unchecked error condition during an xfs attribute change, because xfs_attr_shortform_addname in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_attr.c mishandles ATTR_REPLACE operations with conversion of an attr from short to long form.
CVE-2018-18559	2018-10-22	2023-05-16	8.1	1.22%			In the Linux kernel through 4.19, a use-after-free can occur due to a race condition between fanout_add from setsockopt and bind on an AF_PACKET socket. This issue exists because of the 15fe076edea787807a7cdc168df832544b58eba6 incomplete fix for a race condition. The code mishandles a certain multithreaded case involving a packet_do_bind unregister action followed by a packet_notifier register action. Later, packet_release operates on only one of the two applicable linked lists. The attacker can achieve Program Counter control.
CVE-2018-18445	2018-10-17	2023-01-17	7.8	0.05%			In the Linux kernel 4.14.x, 4.15.x, 4.16.x, 4.17.x, and 4.18.x before 4.18.13, faulty computation of numeric bounds in the BPF verifier permits out-of-bounds memory accesses because adjust_scalar_min_max_vals in kernel/bpf/verifier.c mishandles 32-bit right shifts.
CVE-2018-18397	2018-12-12	2020-08-24	5.5	0.04%			The userfaultfd implementation in the Linux kernel before 4.19.7 mishandles access control for certain UFFDIO_ ioctl calls, as demonstrated by allowing local users to write data into holes in a tmpfs file (if the user has read-only access to that file, and that file contains holes), related to fs/userfaultfd.c and mm/userfaultfd.c.
CVE-2018-18386	2018-10-17	2019-04-23	3.3	0.04%			drivers/tty/n_tty.c in the Linux kernel before 4.14.11 allows local attackers (who are able to access pseudo terminals) to hang/block further usage of any pseudo terminal devices due to an EXTPROC versus ICANON confusion in TIOCINQ.
CVE-2018-18281	2018-10-30	2020-08-24	7.8	0.09%			Since Linux kernel version 3.2, the mremap() syscall performs TLB flushes after dropping pagetable locks. If a syscall such as ftruncate() removes entries from the pagetables of a task that is in the middle of mremap(), a stale TLB entry can remain for a short time that permits access to a physical page after it has been released back to the page allocator and reused. This is fixed in the following kernel versions: 4.9.135, 4.14.78, 4.18.16, 4.19.
CVE-2018-18021	2018-10-07	2019-04-03	7.1	0.05%			arch/arm64/kvm/guest.c in KVM in the Linux kernel before 4.18.12 on the arm64 platform mishandles the KVM_SET_ON_REG ioctl. This is exploitable by attackers who can create virtual machines. An attacker can arbitrarily redirect the hypervisor flow of control (with full register control). An attacker can also cause a denial of service (hypervisor panic) via an illegal exception return. This occurs because of insufficient restrictions on userspace access to the core register file, and because PSTATE.M validation does not prevent unintended execution modes.
CVE-2018-17977	2018-10-08	2018-11-26	4.9	0.04%			The Linux kernel 4.14.67 mishandles certain interaction among XFRM Netlink messages, IPPROTO_AH packets, and IPPROTO_IP packets, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and system hang) by leveraging root access to execute crafted applications, as demonstrated on CentOS 7.
CVE-2018-17972	2018-10-03	2020-10-15	5.5	0.04%			An issue was discovered in the proc_pid_stack function in fs/proc/base.c in the Linux kernel through 4.18.11. It does not ensure that only root may inspect the kernel stack of an arbitrary task, allowing a local attacker to exploit racy stack unwinding and leak kernel task stack contents.
CVE-2018-17182	2018-09-19	2023-02-24	7.8	0.11%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.18.8. The vmacache_flush_all function in mm/vmacache.c mishandles sequence number overflows. An attacker can trigger a use-after-free (and possibly gain privileges) via certain thread creation, map, unmap, invalidation, and dereference operations.
CVE-2018-16884	2018-12-18	2023-08-11	8.0	0.05%			A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's NFS41+ subsystem. NFS41+ shares mounted in different network namespaces at the same time can make bc_svc_process() use wrong back-channel IDs and cause a use-after-free vulnerability. Thus a malicious container user can cause a host kernel memory corruption and a system panic. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out.
CVE-2018-16862	2018-11-26	2019-04-01	5.5	0.05%			A security flaw was found in the Linux kernel in a way that the cleancache subsystem clears an inode after the final file truncation (removal). The new file created with the same inode may contain leftover pages from cleancache and the old file data instead of the new one.
CVE-2018-16658	2018-09-07	2019-08-06	6.1	0.04%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.18.6. An information leak in cdrom_ioctl_drive_status in drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c could be used by local attackers to read kernel memory because a cast from unsigned long to int interferes with bounds checking. This is similar to CVE-2018-10940.
CVE-2018-16597	2018-09-21	2019-10-03	5.5	0.04%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.8. Incorrect access checking in overlayfs mounts could be used by local attackers to modify or truncate files in the underlying filesystem.
CVE-2018-16276	2018-08-31	2023-02-24	7.8	0.04%			An issue was discovered in yurex_read in drivers/usb/misc/yurex.c in the Linux kernel before 4.17.7. Local attackers could use user access read/writes with incorrect bounds checking in the yurex USB driver to crash the kernel or potentially escalate privileges.
CVE-2018-15594	2018-08-20	2019-10-03	5.5	0.06%			arch/x86/kernel/paravirt.c in the Linux kernel before 4.18.1 mishandles certain indirect calls, which makes it easier for attackers to conduct Spectre-v2 attacks against paravirtual guests.
CVE-2018-15572	2018-08-20	2019-10-03	6.5	0.06%			The spectre_v2_select_mitigation function in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/bugs.c in the Linux kernel before 4.18.1 does not always fill RSB upon a context switch, which makes it easier for attackers to conduct userspace-userspace spectreRSB attacks.
CVE-2018-15471	2018-08-17	2020-08-24	7.8	0.06%			An issue was discovered in xenvif_set_hash_mapping in drivers/net/xen-netback/hash.c in the Linux kernel through 4.18.1, as used in Xen through 4.11.x and other products. The Linux netback driver allows frontends to control mapping of requests to request queues. When processing a request to set or change this mapping, some input validation (e.g., for an integer overflow) was missing or flawed, leading to OOB access in hash handling. A malicious or buggy frontend may cause the (usually privileged) backend to make out of bounds memory accesses, potentially resulting in one or more of privilege escalation, Denial of Service (DoS), or information leaks.
CVE-2018-14734	2018-07-29	2019-04-23	7.8	0.06%			drivers/infiniband/core/ucma.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.11 allows ucma_leave_multicast to access a certain data structure after a cleanup step in ucma_process_join, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free).
CVE-2018-14678	2018-07-28	2023-02-24	7.8	0.04%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.11, as used in Xen through 4.11.x. The xen_failsafe_callback entry point in arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S does not properly maintain RBX, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory usage and system crash). Within Xen, 64-bit x86 PV Linux guest OS users can trigger a guest OS crash or possibly gain privileges.
CVE-2018-14656	2018-10-08	2023-02-13	7.0	0.05%			A missing address check in the callers of the show_opcodes() in the Linux kernel allows an attacker to dump the kernel memory at an arbitrary kernel address into the dmesg log.
CVE-2018-14646	2018-11-26	2019-10-09	5.5	0.04%			The Linux kernel before 4.15-rc8 was found to be vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference bug in the __netlink_ns_capable() function in the net/netlink/af_netlink.c file. A local attacker could exploit this when a net namespace with a netnsid is assigned to cause a kernel panic and a denial of service.
CVE-2018-14641	2018-09-18	2019-10-09	7.1	0.36%			A security flaw was found in the ip_frag_reasm() function in net/ipv4/ip_fragment.c in the Linux kernel from 4.19-rc1 to 4.19-rc3 inclusive, which can cause a later system crash in ip_do_fragment(). With certain non-default, but non-rare, configuration of a victim host, an attacker can trigger this crash remotely, thus leading to a remote denial-of-service.
CVE-2018-14634	2018-09-25	2023-02-13	7.8	0.04%			An integer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's create_elf_tables() function. An unprivileged local user with access to SUID (or otherwise privileged) binary could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system. Kernel versions 2.6.x, 3.10.x and 4.14.x are believed to be vulnerable.
CVE-2018-14633	2018-09-25	2023-02-14	8.3	1.70%			A security flaw was found in the chap_server_compute_md5() function in the ISCSI target code in the Linux kernel in a way an authentication request from an ISCSI initiator is processed. An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a stack buffer overflow and smash up to 17 bytes of the stack. The attack requires the iSCSI target to be enabled on the victim host. Depending on how the target's code was built (i.e. depending on a compiler, compile flags and hardware architecture) an attack may lead to a system crash and thus to a denial-of-service or possibly to a non-authorized access to data exported by an iSCSI target. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is highly unlikely. Kernel versions 4.18.x, 4.14.x and 3.10.x are believed to be vulnerable.
CVE-2018-14625	2018-09-10	2023-02-13	7.0	0.06%			A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel where an attacker may be able to have an uncontrolled read to kernel-memory from within a vm guest. A race condition between connect() and close() function may allow an attacker using the AF_VSOCK protocol to gather a 4 byte information leak or possibly intercept or corrupt AF_VSOCK messages destined to other clients.
CVE-2018-14619	2018-08-30	2023-02-24	7.8	0.04%			A flaw was found in the crypto subsystem of the Linux kernel before version kernel-4.15-rc4. The "null skcipher" was being dropped when each af_alg_ctx was freed instead of when the aead_tfm was freed. This can cause the null skcipher to be freed while it is still in use leading to a local user being able to crash the system or possibly escalate privileges.
CVE-2018-14617	2018-07-27	2019-08-13	7.1	0.09%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.10. There is a NULL pointer dereference and panic in hfsplus_lookup() in fs/hfsplus/dir.c when opening a file (that is purportedly a hard link) in an hfs+ filesystem that has malformed catalog data, and is mounted read-only without a metadata directory.
CVE-2018-14616	2018-07-27	2019-04-03	7.1	0.15%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.10. There is a NULL pointer dereference in fscrypt_do_page_crypto() in fs/crypto/crypto.c when operating on a file in a corrupted f2fs image.

CVE-2018-14614	2018-07-27	2019-04-03	7.1	0.15%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.10. There is an out-of-bounds access in __remove_dirty_segment() in fs/f2fs/segment.c when mounting an f2fs image.
CVE-2018-14613	2018-07-27	2021-06-14	7.1	0.12%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.10. There is an invalid pointer dereference in io_ctl_map_page() when mounting and operating a crafted btrfs image, because of a lack of block group item validation in check_leaf_item in fs/btrfs/tree-checker.c.
CVE-2018-14612	2018-07-27	2020-06-10	7.1	0.12%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.10. There is an invalid pointer dereference in btrfs_root_node() when mounting a crafted btrfs image, because of a lack of chunk block group mapping validation in btrfs_read_block_groups in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c, and a lack of empty-tree checks in check_leaf in fs/btrfs/tree-checker.c.
CVE-2018-14611	2018-07-27	2020-06-10	7.1	0.09%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.10. There is a use-after-free in try_merge_free_space() when mounting a crafted btrfs image, because of a lack of chunk type flag checks in btrfs_check_chunk_valid in fs/btrfs/volumes.c.
CVE-2018-14610	2018-07-27	2020-06-10	7.1	0.12%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.10. There is out-of-bounds access in write_extent_buffer() when mounting and operating a crafted btrfs image, because of a lack of verification that each block group has a corresponding chunk at mount time, within btrfs_read_block_groups in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c.
CVE-2018-14609	2018-07-27	2019-08-13	7.1	0.09%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.10. There is an invalid pointer dereference in __del_reloc_root() in fs/btrfs/relocation.c when mounting a crafted btrfs image, related to removing reloc rb_trees when reloc control has not been initialized.
CVE-2018-13406	2018-07-06	2023-02-24	7.8	0.04%			An integer overflow in the uvesafb_setcmap function in drivers/video/fbdev/uvesafb.c in the Linux kernel before 4.17.4 could result in local attackers being able to crash the kernel or potentially elevate privileges because kmalloc_array is not used.
CVE-2018-13405	2018-07-06	2022-04-06	7.8	0.04%			The inode_init_owner function in fs/inode.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16 allows local users to create files with an unintended group ownership, in a scenario where a directory is SGID to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of that group. Here, the non-member can trigger creation of a plain file whose group ownership is that group. The intended behavior was that the non-member can trigger creation of a directory (but not a plain file) whose group ownership is that group. The non-member can escalate privileges by making the plain file executable and SGID.
CVE-2018-13100	2018-07-03	2019-04-03	5.5	0.24%			An issue was discovered in fs/f2fs/super.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3, which does not properly validate secs_per_zone in a corrupted f2fs image, as demonstrated by a divide-by-zero error.
CVE-2018-13099	2018-07-03	2022-10-07	5.5	0.11%			An issue was discovered in fs/f2fs/inline.c in the Linux kernel through 4.4. A denial of service (out-of-bounds memory access and BUG) can occur for a modified f2fs filesystem image in which an inline inode contains an invalid reserved blkaddr.
CVE-2018-13098	2018-07-03	2019-08-13	5.5	0.17%			An issue was discovered in fs/f2fs/inode.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. A denial of service (slab out-of-bounds read and BUG) can occur for a modified f2fs filesystem image in which FI_EXTRA_ATTR is set in an inode.
CVE-2018-13097	2018-07-03	2019-04-03	5.5	0.26%			An issue was discovered in fs/f2fs/super.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. There is an out-of-bounds read or a divide-by-zero error for an incorrect user_block_count in a corrupted f2fs image, leading to a denial of service (BUG).
CVE-2018-13096	2018-07-03	2022-10-07	5.5	0.24%			An issue was discovered in fs/f2fs/super.c in the Linux kernel through 4.14. A denial of service (out-of-bounds memory access and BUG) can occur upon encountering an abnormal bitmap size when mounting a crafted f2fs image.
CVE-2018-13095	2018-07-03	2020-08-24	5.5	0.18%			An issue was discovered in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_inode_buf.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. A denial of service (memory corruption and BUG) can occur for a corrupted xfs image upon encountering an inode that is in extent format, but has more extents than fit in the inode fork.
CVE-2018-13094	2018-07-03	2019-04-23	5.5	0.30%			An issue was discovered in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_attr_leaf.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. An OOPS may occur for a corrupted xfs image after xfs_da_shrink_inode() is called with a NULL bp.
CVE-2018-13093	2018-07-03	2019-08-06	5.5	0.19%			An issue was discovered in fs/xfs/xfs_icache.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. There is a NULL pointer dereference and panic in lookup_slow() on a NULL inode->i_ops pointer when doing pathwalks on a corrupted xfs image. This occurs because of a lack of proper validation that cached inodes are free during allocation.

CVE-2018-12896	2018-07-02	2019-04-03	5.5	0.04%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. An Integer Overflow in kernel/time/posix-timers.c in the POSIX timer code is caused by the way the overrun accounting works. Depending on interval and expiry time values, the overrun can be larger than INT_MAX, but the accounting is int based. This basically makes the accounting values, which are visible to user space via timer_getoverrun(2) and siginfo::si_overrun, random. For example, a local user can cause a denial of service (signed integer overflow) via crafted mmap, futex, timer_create, and timer_settime system calls.

CVE-2017-2634	2018-07-27	2023-02-12	7.8	3.54%			It was found that the Linux kernel's Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) implementation before 2.6.22.17 used the IPv4-only inet_sk_rebuild_header() function for both IPv4 and IPv6 DCCP connections, which could result in memory corruptions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system.
CVE-2017-2618	2018-07-27	2023-02-12	5.5	0.06%			A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handling of clearing SELinux attributes on /proc/pid/attr files before 4.9.10. An empty (null) write to this file can crash the system by causing the system to attempt to access unmapped kernel memory.
CVE-2016-10723	2018-06-21	2018-08-21	5.5	0.05%			** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2. Since the page allocator does not yield CPU resources to the owner of the oom_lock mutex, a local unprivileged user can trivially lock up the system forever by wasting CPU resources from the page allocator (e.g., via concurrent page fault events) when the global OOM killer is invoked. NOTE: the software maintainer has not accepted certain proposed patches, in part because of a viewpoint that "the underlying problem is non-trivial to handle."
CVE-2016-9604	2018-07-11	2019-10-09	4.4	0.06%			It was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.11-rc8 that root can gain direct access to an internal keyring, such as '.dns_resolver' in RHEL-7 or '.builtin_trusted_keys' upstream, by joining it as its session keyring. This allows root to bypass module signature verification by adding a new public key of its own devising to the keyring.
CVE-2014-8171	2018-02-09	2023-02-13	5.5	0.04%			The memory resource controller (aka memcg) in the Linux kernel allows local users to cause a denial of service (deadlock) by spawning new processes within a memory-constrained cgroup.
