The mwifiex_cmd_append_vsie_tlv() function in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/scan.c allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service because of an incorrect memcpy and buffer overflow, aka CID-b70261a288ea.
CVE-2020-12652	2020-05-05	2020-06-13	4.7	0.04%			The __mptctl_ioctl function in drivers/message/fusion/mptctl.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.14 allows local users to hold an incorrect lock during the ioctl operation and trigger a race condition, i.e., a "double fetch" vulnerability, aka CID-28d76df18f0a. NOTE: the vendor states "The security impact of this bug is not as bad as it could have been because these operations are all privileged and root already has enormous destructive power."
CVE-2020-12465	2020-04-29	2020-06-08	7.2	0.04%			An array overflow was discovered in mt76_add_fragment in drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt76/dma.c in the Linux kernel before 5.5.10, aka CID-b102f0c522cf. An oversized packet with too many rx fragments can corrupt memory of adjacent pages.
CVE-2020-12464	2020-04-29	2020-06-22	7.2	0.09%			usb_sg_cancel in drivers/usb/core/message.c in the Linux kernel before 5.6.8 has a use-after-free because a transfer occurs without a reference, aka CID-056ad39ee925.
CVE-2020-12352	2020-11-23	2022-08-12	6.5	0.22%			Improper access control in BlueZ may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via adjacent access.
CVE-2020-12351	2020-11-23	2022-12-06	8.8	0.16%			Improper input validation in BlueZ may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via adjacent access.
CVE-2020-12114	2020-05-04	2021-06-14	4.7	0.04%			A pivot_root race condition in fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel 4.4.x before 4.4.221, 4.9.x before 4.9.221, 4.14.x before 4.14.178, 4.19.x before 4.19.119, and 5.x before 5.3 allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) by corrupting a mountpoint reference counter.
CVE-2020-11884	2020-04-29	2022-10-29	7.0	0.05%			In the Linux kernel 4.19 through 5.6.7 on the s390 platform, code execution may occur because of a race condition, as demonstrated by code in enable_sacf_uaccess in arch/s390/lib/uaccess.c that fails to protect against a concurrent page table upgrade, aka CID-3f777e19d171. A crash could also occur.
CVE-2020-11725	2020-04-12	2020-04-14	7.8	0.09%			** DISPUTED ** snd_ctl_elem_add in sound/core/control.c in the Linux kernel through 5.6.3 has a count=info->owner line, which later affects a private_size*count multiplication for unspecified "interesting side effects." NOTE: kernel engineers dispute this finding, because it could be relevant only if new callers were added that were unfamiliar with the misuse of the info->owner field to represent data unrelated to the "owner" concept. The existing callers, SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_ADD and SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_REPLACE, have been designed to misuse the info->owner field in a safe way.
CVE-2020-11669	2020-04-10	2020-05-28	5.5	0.05%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.2 on the powerpc platform. arch/powerpc/kernel/idle_book3s.S does not have save/restore functionality for PNV_POWERSAVE_AMR, PNV_POWERSAVE_UAMOR, and PNV_POWERSAVE_AMOR, aka CID-53a712bae5dd.
CVE-2020-11668	2020-04-09	2020-06-10	7.1	0.05%			In the Linux kernel before 5.6.1, drivers/media/usb/gspca/xirlink_cit.c (aka the Xirlink camera USB driver) mishandles invalid descriptors, aka CID-a246b4d54770.
CVE-2020-11609	2020-04-07	2020-06-13	4.9	0.05%			An issue was discovered in the stv06xx subsystem in the Linux kernel before 5.6.1. drivers/media/usb/gspca/stv06xx/stv06xx.c and drivers/media/usb/gspca/stv06xx/stv06xx_pb0100.c mishandle invalid descriptors, as demonstrated by a NULL pointer dereference, aka CID-485b06aadb93.

NOTE: Someone in the security community disagrees that this is a vulnerability because the issue “is a bug in parsing mount options which can only be specified by a privileged user, so triggering the bug does not grant any powers not already held.”.
CVE-2020-11494	2020-04-02	2022-04-29	4.4	0.05%			An issue was discovered in slc_bump in drivers/net/can/slcan.c in the Linux kernel 3.16 through 5.6.2. It allows attackers to read uninitialized can_frame data, potentially containing sensitive information from kernel stack memory, if the configuration lacks CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL, aka CID-b9258a2cece4.
CVE-2020-10942	2020-03-24	2022-04-22	5.4	0.06%			In the Linux kernel before 5.5.8, get_raw_socket in drivers/vhost/net.c lacks validation of an sk_family field, which might allow attackers to trigger kernel stack corruption via crafted system calls.
CVE-2020-10781	2020-09-16	2022-11-07	5.5	0.04%			A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel before 5.8-rc6 in the ZRAM kernel module, where a user with a local account and the ability to read the /sys/class/zram-control/hot_add file can create ZRAM device nodes in the /dev/ directory. This read allocates kernel memory and is not accounted for a user that triggers the creation of that ZRAM device. With this vulnerability, continually reading the device may consume a large amount of system memory and cause the Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer to activate and terminate random userspace processes, possibly making the system inoperable.
CVE-2020-10773	2020-09-10	2021-10-26	4.4	0.04%			A stack information leak flaw was found in s390/s390x in the Linux kernel’s memory manager functionality, where it incorrectly writes to the /proc/sys/vm/cmm_timeout file. This flaw allows a local user to see the kernel data.
CVE-2020-10768	2020-09-16	2020-09-22	5.5	0.04%			A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel before 5.8-rc1 in the prctl() function, where it can be used to enable indirect branch speculation after it has been disabled. This call incorrectly reports it as being 'force disabled' when it is not and opens the system to Spectre v2 attacks. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.
CVE-2020-10767	2020-09-15	2020-09-23	5.5	0.04%			A flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.8-rc1 in the implementation of the Enhanced IBPB (Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier). The IBPB mitigation will be disabled when STIBP is not available or when the Enhanced Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS) is available. This flaw allows a local attacker to perform a Spectre V2 style attack when this configuration is active. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.
CVE-2020-10766	2020-09-15	2020-09-23	5.5	0.04%			A logic bug flaw was found in Linux kernel before 5.8-rc1 in the implementation of SSBD. A bug in the logic handling allows an attacker with a local account to disable SSBD protection during a context switch when additional speculative execution mitigations are in place. This issue was introduced when the per task/process conditional STIPB switching was added on top of the existing SSBD switching. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.
CVE-2020-10757	2020-06-09	2023-02-12	7.8	0.04%			A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel in versions after 4.5-rc1 in the way mremap handled DAX Huge Pages. This flaw allows a local attacker with access to a DAX enabled storage to escalate their privileges on the system.
CVE-2020-10732	2020-06-12	2023-06-06	4.4	0.05%			A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of Userspace core dumps. This flaw allows an attacker with a local account to crash a trivial program and exfiltrate private kernel data.
CVE-2020-10720	2020-09-03	2020-09-10	5.5	0.04%			A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of GRO in versions before 5.2. This flaw allows an attacker with local access to crash the system.
CVE-2020-10711	2020-05-22	2022-04-22	5.9	0.60%			A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SELinux subsystem in versions before 5.7. This flaw occurs while importing the Commercial IP Security Option (CIPSO) protocol's category bitmap into the SELinux extensible bitmap via the' ebitmap_netlbl_import' routine. While processing the CIPSO restricted bitmap tag in the 'cipso_v4_parsetag_rbm' routine, it sets the security attribute to indicate that the category bitmap is present, even if it has not been allocated. This issue leads to a NULL pointer dereference issue while importing the same category bitmap into SELinux. This flaw allows a remote network user to crash the system kernel, resulting in a denial of service.
CVE-2020-10690	2020-05-08	2021-12-20	6.5	0.05%			There is a use-after-free in kernel versions before 5.5 due to a race condition between the release of ptp_clock and cdev while resource deallocation. When a (high privileged) process allocates a ptp device file (like /dev/ptpX) and voluntarily goes to sleep. During this time if the underlying device is removed, it can cause an exploitable condition as the process wakes up to terminate and clean all attached files. The system crashes due to the cdev structure being invalid (as already freed) which is pointed to by the inode.
CVE-2020-9391	2020-02-25	2022-04-18	5.5	0.06%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.4 and 5.5 through 5.5.6 on the AArch64 architecture. It ignores the top byte in the address passed to the brk system call, potentially moving the memory break downwards when the application expects it to move upwards, aka CID-dcde237319e6. This has been observed to cause heap corruption with the GNU C Library malloc implementation.
CVE-2020-9383	2020-02-25	2022-10-29	7.1	0.05%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 3.16 through 5.5.6. set_fdc in drivers/block/floppy.c leads to a wait_til_ready out-of-bounds read because the FDC index is not checked for errors before assigning it, aka CID-2e90ca68b0d2.
CVE-2020-8992	2020-02-14	2022-04-27	5.5	0.05%			ext4_protect_reserved_inode in fs/ext4/block_validity.c in the Linux kernel through 5.5.3 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (soft lockup) via a crafted journal size.
CVE-2020-8835	2020-04-02	2023-02-24	7.8	0.09%			In the Linux kernel 5.5.0 and newer, the bpf verifier (kernel/bpf/verifier.c) did not properly restrict the register bounds for 32-bit operations, leading to out-of-bounds reads and writes in kernel memory. The vulnerability also affects the Linux 5.4 stable series, starting with v5.4.7, as the introducing commit was backported to that branch. This vulnerability was fixed in 5.6.1, 5.5.14, and 5.4.29. (issue is aka ZDI-CAN-10780)
CVE-2020-8834	2020-04-09	2022-10-07	6.5	0.05%			KVM in the Linux kernel on Power8 processors has a conflicting use of HSTATE_HOST_R1 to store r1 state in kvmppc_hv_entry plus in kvmppc_{save,restore}_tm, leading to a stack corruption. Because of this, an attacker with the ability run code in kernel space of a guest VM can cause the host kernel to panic. There were two commits that, according to the reporter, introduced the vulnerability: f024ee098476 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Pull out TM state save/restore into separate procedures") 87a11bb6a7f7 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Work around XER[SO] bug in fake suspend mode") The former landed in 4.8, the latter in 4.17. This was fixed without realizing the impact in 4.18 with the following three commits, though it's believed the first is the only strictly necessary commit: 6f597c6b63b6 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Add guest MSR parameter for kvmppc_save_tm()/kvmppc_restore_tm()") 7b0e827c6970 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Factor fake-suspend handling out of kvmppc_save/restore_tm") 009c872a8bc4 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Move kvmppc_save_tm/kvmppc_restore_tm to separate file")
CVE-2020-8649	2020-02-06	2021-12-30	5.9	0.06%			There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel through 5.5.2 in the vgacon_invert_region function in drivers/video/console/vgacon.c.
CVE-2020-8648	2020-02-06	2022-07-28	7.1	0.08%			There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel through 5.5.2 in the n_tty_receive_buf_common function in drivers/tty/n_tty.c.
CVE-2020-8647	2020-02-06	2021-12-30	6.1	0.05%			There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel through 5.5.2 in the vc_do_resize function in drivers/tty/vt/vt.c.
CVE-2020-8428	2020-01-29	2020-06-10	7.1	0.04%			fs/namei.c in the Linux kernel before 5.5 has a may_create_in_sticky use-after-free, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS) or possibly obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-d0cb50185ae9. One attack vector may be an open system call for a UNIX domain socket, if the socket is being moved to a new parent directory and its old parent directory is being removed.
CVE-2020-7053	2020-01-14	2020-01-30	7.8	0.05%			In the Linux kernel 4.14 longterm through 4.14.165 and 4.19 longterm through 4.19.96 (and 5.x before 5.2), there is a use-after-free (write) in the i915_ppgtt_close function in drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem_gtt.c, aka CID-7dc40713618c. This is related to i915_gem_context_destroy_ioctl in drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem_context.c.
CVE-2020-1749	2020-09-09	2021-07-15	7.5	0.18%			A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of some networking protocols in IPsec, such as VXLAN and GENEVE tunnels over IPv6. When an encrypted tunnel is created between two hosts, the kernel isn't correctly routing tunneled data over the encrypted link; rather sending the data unencrypted. This would allow anyone in between the two endpoints to read the traffic unencrypted. The main threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.
CVE-2019-20934	2020-11-28	2021-01-12	5.4	0.04%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.2.6. On NUMA systems, the Linux fair scheduler has a use-after-free in show_numa_stats() because NUMA fault statistics are inappropriately freed, aka CID-16d51a590a8c.
CVE-2019-20908	2020-07-15	2021-07-21	6.9	0.05%			An issue was discovered in drivers/firmware/efi/efi.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4. Incorrect access permissions for the efivar_ssdt ACPI variable could be used by attackers to bypass lockdown or secure boot restrictions, aka CID-1957a85b0032.
CVE-2019-20812	2020-06-03	2021-06-14	5.5	0.05%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.4.7. The prb_calc_retire_blk_tmo() function in net/packet/af_packet.c can result in a denial of service (CPU consumption and soft lockup) in a certain failure case involving TPACKET_V3, aka CID-b43d1f9f7067.
CVE-2019-20811	2020-06-03	2023-01-20	5.5	0.05%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.0.6. In rx_queue_add_kobject() and netdev_queue_add_kobject() in net/core/net-sysfs.c, a reference count is mishandled, aka CID-a3e23f719f5c.
CVE-2019-20810	2020-06-03	2022-04-28	5.5	0.05%			go7007_snd_init in drivers/media/usb/go7007/snd-go7007.c in the Linux kernel before 5.6 does not call snd_card_free for a failure path, which causes a memory leak, aka CID-9453264ef586.
CVE-2019-20806	2020-05-27	2020-06-19	4.4	0.05%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.2. There is a NULL pointer dereference in tw5864_handle_frame() in drivers/media/pci/tw5864/tw5864-video.c, which may cause denial of service, aka CID-2e7682ebfc75.
CVE-2019-20794	2020-05-09	2021-07-21	4.7	0.07%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 4.18 through 5.6.11 when unprivileged user namespaces are allowed. A user can create their own PID namespace, and mount a FUSE filesystem. Upon interaction with this FUSE filesystem, if the userspace component is terminated via a kill of the PID namespace's pid 1, it will result in a hung task, and resources being permanently locked up until system reboot. This can result in resource exhaustion.
CVE-2019-20636	2020-04-08	2020-06-10	7.2	0.05%			In the Linux kernel before 5.4.12, drivers/input/input.c has out-of-bounds writes via a crafted keycode table, as demonstrated by input_set_keycode, aka CID-cb222aed03d7.
CVE-2019-20422	2020-01-27	2020-03-13	5.5	0.04%			In the Linux kernel before 5.3.4, fib6_rule_lookup in net/ipv6/ip6_fib.c mishandles the RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF flag in a reference-count decision, leading to (for example) a crash that was identified by syzkaller, aka CID-7b09c2d052db.
CVE-2019-19338	2020-07-13	2020-07-21	5.5	0.05%			A flaw was found in the fix for CVE-2019-11135, in the Linux upstream kernel versions before 5.5 where, the way Intel CPUs handle speculative execution of instructions when a TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA) error occurs. When a guest is running on a host CPU affected by the TAA flaw (TAA_NO=0), but is not affected by the MDS issue (MDS_NO=1), the guest was to clear the affected buffers by using a VERW instruction mechanism. But when the MDS_NO=1 bit was exported to the guests, the guests did not use the VERW mechanism to clear the affected buffers. This issue affects guests running on Cascade Lake CPUs and requires that host has 'TSX' enabled. Confidentiality of data is the highest threat associated with this vulnerability.
CVE-2019-19332	2020-01-09	2023-02-12	6.1	0.07%			An out-of-bounds memory write issue was found in the Linux Kernel, version 3.13 through 5.4, in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled the 'KVM_GET_EMULATED_CPUID' ioctl(2) request to get CPUID features emulated by the KVM hypervisor. A user or process able to access the '/dev/kvm' device could use this flaw to crash the system, resulting in a denial of service.
CVE-2019-18282	2020-01-16	2022-04-18	5.3	0.30%			The flow_dissector feature in the Linux kernel 4.3 through 5.x before 5.3.10 has a device tracking vulnerability, aka CID-55667441c84f. This occurs because the auto flowlabel of a UDP IPv6 packet relies on a 32-bit hashrnd value as a secret, and because jhash (instead of siphash) is used. The hashrnd value remains the same starting from boot time, and can be inferred by an attacker. This affects net/core/flow_dissector.c and related code.
CVE-2019-15794	2020-04-24	2020-05-26	7.2	0.05%			Overlayfs in the Linux kernel and shiftfs, a non-upstream patch to the Linux kernel included in the Ubuntu 5.0 and 5.3 kernel series, both replace vma->vm_file in their mmap handlers. On error the original value is not restored, and the reference is put for the file to which vm_file points. On upstream kernels this is not an issue, as no callers dereference vm_file following after call_mmap() returns an error. However, the aufs patchs change mmap_region() to replace the fput() using a local variable with vma_fput(), which will fput() vm_file, leading to a refcount underflow.
CVE-2019-15793	2020-04-24	2020-05-01	8.8	0.04%			In shiftfs, a non-upstream patch to the Linux kernel included in the Ubuntu 5.0 and 5.3 kernel series, several locations which shift ids translate user/group ids before performing operations in the lower filesystem were translating them into init_user_ns, whereas they should have been translated into the s_user_ns for the lower filesystem. This resulted in using ids other than the intended ones in the lower fs, which likely did not map into the shifts s_user_ns. A local attacker could use this to possibly bypass discretionary access control permissions.
CVE-2019-15792	2020-04-24	2020-05-01	7.8	0.05%			In shiftfs, a non-upstream patch to the Linux kernel included in the Ubuntu 5.0 and 5.3 kernel series, shiftfs_btrfs_ioctl_fd_replace() calls fdget(oldfd), then without further checks passes the resulting file* into shiftfs_real_fdget(), which casts file->private_data, a void* that points to a filesystem-dependent type, to a "struct shiftfs_file_info *". As the private_data is not required to be a pointer, an attacker can use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.
CVE-2019-15791	2020-04-24	2020-05-01	7.8	0.04%			In shiftfs, a non-upstream patch to the Linux kernel included in the Ubuntu 5.0 and 5.3 kernel series, shiftfs_btrfs_ioctl_fd_replace() installs an fd referencing a file from the lower filesystem without taking an additional reference to that file. After the btrfs ioctl completes this fd is closed, which then puts a reference to that file, leading to a refcount underflow.
CVE-2019-14898	2020-05-08	2023-02-12	7.0	0.04%			The fix for CVE-2019-11599, affecting the Linux kernel before 5.0.10 was not complete. A local user could use this flaw to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service, or possibly have other unspecified impacts by triggering a race condition with mmget_not_zero or get_task_mm calls.
CVE-2019-9500	2020-01-16	2023-01-19	8.3	0.68%			The Broadcom brcmfmac WiFi driver prior to commit 1b5e2423164b3670e8bc9174e4762d297990deff is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. If the Wake-up on Wireless LAN functionality is configured, a malicious event frame can be constructed to trigger an heap buffer overflow in the brcmf_wowl_nd_results function. This vulnerability can be exploited with compromised chipsets to compromise the host, or when used in combination with CVE-2019-9503, can be used remotely. In the worst case scenario, by sending specially-crafted WiFi packets, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. More typically, this vulnerability will result in denial-of-service conditions.
CVE-2019-3016	2020-01-31	2020-06-10	6.2	0.05%			In a Linux KVM guest that has PV TLB enabled, a process in the guest kernel may be able to read memory locations from another process in the same guest. This problem is limit to the host running linux kernel 4.10 with a guest running linux kernel 4.16 or later. The problem mainly affects AMD processors but Intel CPUs cannot be ruled out.
CVE-2012-0810	2020-02-12	2020-02-14	5.5	0.04%			The int3 handler in the Linux kernel before 3.3 relies on a per-CPU debug stack, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack corruption and panic) via a crafted application that triggers certain lock contention.
CVE-2012-0055	2020-02-19	2020-02-28	7.8	0.11%			OverlayFS in the Linux kernel before 3.0.0-16.28, as used in Ubuntu 10.0.4 LTS and 11.10, is missing inode security checks which could allow attackers to bypass security restrictions and perform unauthorized actions.
CVE-2011-4915	2020-02-20	2020-02-25	5.5	0.04%			fs/proc/base.c in the Linux kernel through 3.1 allows local users to obtain sensitive keystroke information via access to /proc/interrupts.
CVE-2011-2498	2020-02-20	2020-02-25	5.5	0.05%			The Linux kernel from v2.3.36 before v2.6.39 allows local unprivileged users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering creation of PTE pages.
CVE-2011-0699	2020-02-20	2020-02-25	7.0	0.04%			Integer signedness error in the btrfs_ioctl_space_info function in the Linux kernel 2.6.37 allows local users to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted slot value.
CVE-2009-4067	2020-02-11	2020-02-12	7.2	0.31%			Buffer overflow in the auerswald_probe function in the Auerswald Linux USB driver for the Linux kernel before 2.6.27 allows physically proximate attackers to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service via a crafted USB device, or take full control of the system.
CVE-2007-4774	2020-01-15	2020-02-04	5.9	0.19%			The Linux kernel before 2.4.36-rc1 has a race condition. It was possible to bypass systrace policies by flooding the ptraced process with SIGCONT signals, which can can wake up a PTRACED process.
