CVE-2011-2909	2014-02-15	2023-02-13	4.9	0.04%			The do_devinfo_ioctl function in drivers/staging/comedi/comedi_fops.c in the Linux kernel before 3.1 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a copy of a short string.
CVE-2010-5313	2014-11-30	2016-11-28	4.9	0.06%			Race condition in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.38 allows L2 guest OS users to cause a denial of service (L1 guest OS crash) via a crafted instruction that triggers an L2 emulation failure report, a similar issue to CVE-2014-7842.
