CVE-2014-9585	2015-01-09	2020-05-21	2.1	0.04%			The vdso_addr function in arch/x86/vdso/vma.c in the Linux kernel through 3.18.2 does not properly choose memory locations for the vDSO area, which makes it easier for local users to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism by guessing a location at the end of a PMD.
CVE-2014-9584	2015-01-09	2023-02-13	2.1	0.04%			The parse_rock_ridge_inode_internal function in fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux kernel before 3.18.2 does not validate a length value in the Extensions Reference (ER) System Use Field, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted iso9660 image.
CVE-2014-9529	2015-01-09	2020-05-21	6.9	0.04%			Race condition in the key_gc_unused_keys function in security/keys/gc.c in the Linux kernel through 3.18.2 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact via keyctl commands that trigger access to a key structure member during garbage collection of a key.
CVE-2014-9428	2015-01-02	2023-01-20	7.8	14.90%			The batadv_frag_merge_packets function in net/batman-adv/fragmentation.c in the B.A.T.M.A.N. implementation in the Linux kernel through 3.18.1 uses an incorrect length field during a calculation of an amount of memory, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (mesh-node system crash) via fragmented packets.
CVE-2014-8173	2015-03-16	2023-02-13	7.2	0.04%			The pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad function in include/asm-generic/pgtable.h in the Linux kernel before 3.13 on NUMA systems does not properly determine whether a Page Middle Directory (PMD) entry is a transparent huge-table entry, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted MADV_WILLNEED madvise system call that leverages the absence of a page-table lock.
CVE-2014-8172	2015-03-16	2023-02-13	4.9	0.04%			The filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.13 performs certain operations on lists of files with an inappropriate locking approach, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (soft lockup or system crash) via unspecified use of Asynchronous I/O (AIO) operations.
CVE-2014-8160	2015-03-02	2023-02-13	5.0	0.36%			net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_generic.c in the Linux kernel before 3.18 generates incorrect conntrack entries during handling of certain iptables rule sets for the SCTP, DCCP, GRE, and UDP-Lite protocols, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via packets with disallowed port numbers.
CVE-2014-8159	2015-03-16	2023-02-13	6.9	0.04%			The InfiniBand (IB) implementation in the Linux kernel package before 2.6.32-504.12.2 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 does not properly restrict use of User Verbs for registration of memory regions, which allows local users to access arbitrary physical memory locations, and consequently cause a denial of service (system crash) or gain privileges, by leveraging permissions on a uverbs device under /dev/infiniband/.
CVE-2014-7822	2015-03-16	2023-02-13	7.2	0.04%			The implementation of certain splice_write file operations in the Linux kernel before 3.16 does not enforce a restriction on the maximum size of a single file, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted splice system call, as demonstrated by use of a file descriptor associated with an ext4 filesystem.
CVE-2014-5332	2015-02-06	2016-09-20	6.9	0.04%			Race condition in NVMap in NVIDIA Tegra Linux Kernel 3.10 allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted NVMAP_IOC_CREATE IOCTL call, which triggers a use-after-free error, as demonstrated by using a race condition to escape the Chrome sandbox.
CVE-2013-7446	2015-12-28	2018-08-13	5.4	0.05%			Use-after-free vulnerability in net/unix/af_unix.c in the Linux kernel before 4.3.3 allows local users to bypass intended AF_UNIX socket permissions or cause a denial of service (panic) via crafted epoll_ctl calls.
CVE-2013-7445	2015-10-16	2015-10-16	7.8	0.15%			The Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.x mishandles requests for Graphics Execution Manager (GEM) objects, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via an application that processes graphics data, as demonstrated by JavaScript code that creates many CANVAS elements for rendering by Chrome or Firefox.
CVE-2013-7421	2015-03-02	2020-05-19	2.1	0.04%			The Crypto API in the Linux kernel before 3.18.5 allows local users to load arbitrary kernel modules via a bind system call for an AF_ALG socket with a module name in the salg_name field, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-9644.
