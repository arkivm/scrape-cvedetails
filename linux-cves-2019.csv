This is related to the vmwgfx or ttm module.
CVE-2019-19922	2019-12-22	2022-12-14	5.5	0.16%			kernel/sched/fair.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.9, when cpu.cfs_quota_us is used (e.g., with Kubernetes), allows attackers to cause a denial of service against non-cpu-bound applications by generating a workload that triggers unwanted slice expiration, aka CID-de53fd7aedb1. (In other words, although this slice expiration would typically be seen with benign workloads, it is possible that an attacker could calculate how many stray requests are required to force an entire Kubernetes cluster into a low-performance state caused by slice expiration, and ensure that a DDoS attack sent that number of stray requests. An attack does not affect the stability of the kernel; it only causes mismanagement of application execution.)

CVE-2019-15239	2019-08-20	2020-08-18	7.8	0.04%			In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. NOTE: this affects (for example) Linux distributions that use 4.9.x longterm kernels before 4.9.190 or 4.14.x longterm kernels before 4.14.139.

CVE-2019-13272	2019-07-17	2023-01-17	7.8	0.05%	2021-12-10	Yes	In the Linux kernel before 5.1.17, ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c mishandles the recording of the credentials of a process that wants to create a ptrace relationship, which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging certain scenarios with a parent-child process relationship, where a parent drops privileges and calls execve (potentially allowing control by an attacker). One contributing factor is an object lifetime issue (which can also cause a panic). Another contributing factor is incorrect marking of a ptrace relationship as privileged, which is exploitable through (for example) Polkit's pkexec helper with PTRACE_TRACEME. NOTE: SELinux deny_ptrace might be a usable workaround in some environments.
CVE-2019-13233	2019-07-04	2019-07-20	7.0	0.08%			In arch/x86/lib/insn-eval.c in the Linux kernel before 5.1.9, there is a use-after-free for access to an LDT entry because of a race condition between modify_ldt() and a #BR exception for an MPX bounds violation.

CVE-2019-12817	2019-06-25	2022-04-18	7.0	0.05%			arch/powerpc/mm/mmu_context_book3s64.c in the Linux kernel before 5.1.15 for powerpc has a bug where unrelated processes may be able to read/write to one another's virtual memory under certain conditions via an mmap above 512 TB. Only a subset of powerpc systems are affected.
CVE-2019-12615	2019-06-03	2021-06-02	7.8	2.21%			An issue was discovered in get_vdev_port_node_info in arch/sparc/kernel/mdesc.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.6. There is an unchecked kstrdup_const of node_info->vdev_port.name, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).
CVE-2019-12614	2019-06-03	2020-02-25	4.7	0.05%			An issue was discovered in dlpar_parse_cc_property in arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/dlpar.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.6. There is an unchecked kstrdup of prop->name, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).
CVE-2019-12456	2019-05-30	2020-08-24	7.8	0.04%			** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the MPT3COMMAND case in _ctl_ioctl_main in drivers/scsi/mpt3sas/mpt3sas_ctl.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. It allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact by changing the value of ioc_number between two kernel reads of that value, aka a "double fetch" vulnerability. NOTE: a third party reports that this is unexploitable because the doubly fetched value is not used.
CVE-2019-12455	2019-05-30	2020-02-10	5.5	0.04%			** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in sunxi_divs_clk_setup in drivers/clk/sunxi/clk-sunxi.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kstrndup of derived_name, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). NOTE: This id is disputed as not being an issue because “The memory allocation that was not checked is part of a code that only runs at boot time, before user processes are started. Therefore, there is no possibility for an unprivileged user to control it, and no denial of service.”.
CVE-2019-12454	2019-05-30	2020-08-24	7.8	0.05%			** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in wcd9335_codec_enable_dec in sound/soc/codecs/wcd9335.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. It uses kstrndup instead of kmemdup_nul, which allows attackers to have an unspecified impact via unknown vectors. NOTE: The vendor disputes this issues as not being a vulnerability because switching to kmemdup_nul() would only fix a security issue if the source string wasn't NUL-terminated, which is not the case.
CVE-2019-12382	2019-05-28	2019-06-19	5.5	0.05%			** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in drm_load_edid_firmware in drivers/gpu/drm/drm_edid_load.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kstrdup of fwstr, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). NOTE: The vendor disputes this issues as not being a vulnerability because kstrdup() returning NULL is handled sufficiently and there is no chance for a NULL pointer dereference.
CVE-2019-12381	2019-05-28	2019-06-20	5.5	0.05%			** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). NOTE: this is disputed because new_ra is never used if it is NULL.
CVE-2019-12380	2019-05-28	2020-08-03	5.5	0.05%			**DISPUTED** An issue was discovered in the efi subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. phys_efi_set_virtual_address_map in arch/x86/platform/efi/efi.c and efi_call_phys_prolog in arch/x86/platform/efi/efi_64.c mishandle memory allocation failures. NOTE: This id is disputed as not being an issue because “All the code touched by the referenced commit runs only at boot, before any user processes are started. Therefore, there is no possibility for an unprivileged user to control it.”.
CVE-2019-12379	2019-05-28	2020-08-24	5.5	0.05%			** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in con_insert_unipair in drivers/tty/vt/consolemap.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is a memory leak in a certain case of an ENOMEM outcome of kmalloc. NOTE: This id is disputed as not being an issue.
CVE-2019-12378	2019-05-28	2019-06-10	5.5	0.05%			** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in ip6_ra_control in net/ipv6/ipv6_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). NOTE: This has been disputed as not an issue.
CVE-2019-11884	2019-05-10	2023-03-03	3.3	0.04%			The do_hidp_sock_ioctl function in net/bluetooth/hidp/sock.c in the Linux kernel before 5.0.15 allows a local user to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a HIDPCONNADD command, because a name field may not end with a '\0' character.
CVE-2019-11833	2019-05-15	2023-03-01	5.5	0.04%			fs/ext4/extents.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.2 does not zero out the unused memory region in the extent tree block, which might allow local users to obtain sensitive information by reading uninitialized data in the filesystem.
CVE-2019-11815	2019-05-08	2021-07-21	9.3	0.53%			An issue was discovered in rds_tcp_kill_sock in net/rds/tcp.c in the Linux kernel before 5.0.8. There is a race condition leading to a use-after-free, related to net namespace cleanup.
CVE-2019-11811	2019-05-07	2023-08-11	7.0	0.05%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.0.4. There is a use-after-free upon attempted read access to /proc/ioports after the ipmi_si module is removed, related to drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_si_intf.c, drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_si_mem_io.c, and drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_si_port_io.c.
CVE-2019-11810	2019-05-07	2022-12-02	7.8	1.24%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.0.7. A NULL pointer dereference can occur when megasas_create_frame_pool() fails in megasas_alloc_cmds() in drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas_base.c. This causes a Denial of Service, related to a use-after-free.
CVE-2019-11683	2019-05-02	2023-01-19	10.0	3.84%			udp_gro_receive_segment in net/ipv4/udp_offload.c in the Linux kernel 5.x before 5.0.13 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (slab-out-of-bounds memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via UDP packets with a 0 payload, because of mishandling of padded packets, aka the "GRO packet of death" issue.
CVE-2019-11599	2019-04-29	2021-06-14	7.0	0.04%			The coredump implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.0.10 does not use locking or other mechanisms to prevent vma layout or vma flags changes while it runs, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service, or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a race condition with mmget_not_zero or get_task_mm calls. This is related to fs/userfaultfd.c, mm/mmap.c, fs/proc/task_mmu.c, and drivers/infiniband/core/uverbs_main.c.
CVE-2019-11487	2019-04-23	2023-02-24	7.8	0.11%			The Linux kernel before 5.1-rc5 allows page->_refcount reference count overflow, with resultant use-after-free issues, if about 140 GiB of RAM exists. This is related to fs/fuse/dev.c, fs/pipe.c, fs/splice.c, include/linux/mm.h, include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h, kernel/trace/trace.c, mm/gup.c, and mm/hugetlb.c. It can occur with FUSE requests.
CVE-2019-11486	2019-04-23	2023-07-07	7.0	0.05%			The Siemens R3964 line discipline driver in drivers/tty/n_r3964.c in the Linux kernel before 5.0.8 has multiple race conditions.
CVE-2019-11479	2019-06-19	2023-08-16	7.5	97.43%			Jonathan Looney discovered that the Linux kernel default MSS is hard-coded to 48 bytes. This allows a remote peer to fragment TCP resend queues significantly more than if a larger MSS were enforced. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. This has been fixed in stable kernel releases 4.4.182, 4.9.182, 4.14.127, 4.19.52, 5.1.11, and is fixed in commits 967c05aee439e6e5d7d805e195b3a20ef5c433d6 and 5f3e2bf008c2221478101ee72f5cb4654b9fc363.
CVE-2019-11478	2019-06-19	2023-08-16	7.5	96.72%			Jonathan Looney discovered that the TCP retransmission queue implementation in tcp_fragment in the Linux kernel could be fragmented when handling certain TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) sequences. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. This has been fixed in stable kernel releases 4.4.182, 4.9.182, 4.14.127, 4.19.52, 5.1.11, and is fixed in commit f070ef2ac66716357066b683fb0baf55f8191a2e.
CVE-2019-11477	2019-06-19	2023-08-16	7.8	97.31%			Jonathan Looney discovered that the TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->tcp_gso_segs value was subject to an integer overflow in the Linux kernel when handling TCP Selective Acknowledgments (SACKs). A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. This has been fixed in stable kernel releases 4.4.182, 4.9.182, 4.14.127, 4.19.52, 5.1.11, and is fixed in commit 3b4929f65b0d8249f19a50245cd88ed1a2f78cff.
CVE-2019-11191	2019-04-12	2019-06-17	2.5	0.04%			** DISPUTED ** The Linux kernel through 5.0.7, when CONFIG_IA32_AOUT is enabled and ia32_aout is loaded, allows local users to bypass ASLR on setuid a.out programs (if any exist) because install_exec_creds() is called too late in load_aout_binary() in fs/binfmt_aout.c, and thus the ptrace_may_access() check has a race condition when reading /proc/pid/stat. NOTE: the software maintainer disputes that this is a vulnerability because ASLR for a.out format executables has never been supported.
CVE-2019-11190	2019-04-12	2019-06-07	4.7	0.04%			The Linux kernel before 4.8 allows local users to bypass ASLR on setuid programs (such as /bin/su) because install_exec_creds() is called too late in load_elf_binary() in fs/binfmt_elf.c, and thus the ptrace_may_access() check has a race condition when reading /proc/pid/stat.
CVE-2019-10639	2019-07-05	2021-06-14	7.5	0.27%			The Linux kernel 4.x (starting from 4.1) and 5.x before 5.0.8 allows Information Exposure (partial kernel address disclosure), leading to a KASLR bypass. Specifically, it is possible to extract the KASLR kernel image offset using the IP ID values the kernel produces for connection-less protocols (e.g., UDP and ICMP). When such traffic is sent to multiple destination IP addresses, it is possible to obtain hash collisions (of indices to the counter array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via enumeration). This key contains enough bits from a kernel address (of a static variable) so when the key is extracted (via enumeration), the offset of the kernel image is exposed. This attack can be carried out remotely, by the attacker forcing the target device to send UDP or ICMP (or certain other) traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. Forcing a server to send UDP traffic is trivial if the server is a DNS server. ICMP traffic is trivial if the server answers ICMP Echo requests (ping). For client targets, if the target visits the attacker's web page, then WebRTC or gQUIC can be used to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. NOTE: this attack against KASLR became viable in 4.1 because IP ID generation was changed to have a dependency on an address associated with a network namespace.
CVE-2019-10638	2019-07-05	2021-06-14	6.5	0.17%			In the Linux kernel before 5.1.7, a device can be tracked by an attacker using the IP ID values the kernel produces for connection-less protocols (e.g., UDP and ICMP). When such traffic is sent to multiple destination IP addresses, it is possible to obtain hash collisions (of indices to the counter array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via enumeration). An attack may be conducted by hosting a crafted web page that uses WebRTC or gQUIC to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses.
CVE-2019-10220	2019-11-27	2022-11-03	9.3	0.25%			Linux kernel CIFS implementation, version 4.9.0 is vulnerable to a relative paths injection in directory entry lists.
CVE-2019-10207	2019-11-25	2023-02-12	5.5	0.04%			A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth implementation of UART, all versions kernel 3.x.x before 4.18.0 and kernel 5.x.x. An attacker with local access and write permissions to the Bluetooth hardware could use this flaw to issue a specially crafted ioctl function call and cause the system to crash.
CVE-2019-10142	2019-07-30	2019-10-09	7.8	0.04%			A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's freescale hypervisor manager implementation, kernel versions 5.0.x up to, excluding 5.0.17. A parameter passed to an ioctl was incorrectly validated and used in size calculations for the page size calculation. An attacker can use this flaw to crash the system, corrupt memory, or create other adverse security affects.
CVE-2019-10140	2019-08-15	2023-02-12	5.5	0.04%			A vulnerability was found in Linux kernel's, versions up to 3.10, implementation of overlayfs. An attacker with local access can create a denial of service situation via NULL pointer dereference in ovl_posix_acl_create function in fs/overlayfs/dir.c. This can allow attackers with ability to create directories on overlayfs to crash the kernel creating a denial of service (DOS).
CVE-2019-10126	2019-06-14	2023-02-12	9.8	1.80%			A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A heap based buffer overflow in mwifiex_uap_parse_tail_ies function in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/ie.c might lead to memory corruption and possibly other consequences.
CVE-2019-10125	2019-03-27	2021-06-02	10.0	21.21%			An issue was discovered in aio_poll() in fs/aio.c in the Linux kernel through 5.0.4. A file may be released by aio_poll_wake() if an expected event is triggered immediately (e.g., by the close of a pair of pipes) after the return of vfs_poll(), and this will cause a use-after-free.
CVE-2019-9857	2019-03-21	2020-08-24	5.5	0.05%			In the Linux kernel through 5.0.2, the function inotify_update_existing_watch() in fs/notify/inotify/inotify_user.c neglects to call fsnotify_put_mark() with IN_MASK_CREATE after fsnotify_find_mark(), which will cause a memory leak (aka refcount leak). Finally, this will cause a denial of service.
CVE-2019-9213	2019-03-05	2022-10-12	5.5	0.09%		Yes	In the Linux kernel before 4.20.14, expand_downwards in mm/mmap.c lacks a check for the mmap minimum address, which makes it easier for attackers to exploit kernel NULL pointer dereferences on non-SMAP platforms. This is related to a capability check for the wrong task.
CVE-2019-9162	2019-02-25	2022-04-05	7.8	0.06%			In the Linux kernel before 4.20.12, net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_nat_snmp_basic_main.c in the SNMP NAT module has insufficient ASN.1 length checks (aka an array index error), making out-of-bounds read and write operations possible, leading to an OOPS or local privilege escalation. This affects snmp_version and snmp_helper.
CVE-2019-9003	2019-02-22	2021-06-02	7.8	0.88%			In the Linux kernel before 4.20.5, attackers can trigger a drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_msghandler.c use-after-free and OOPS by arranging for certain simultaneous execution of the code, as demonstrated by a "service ipmievd restart" loop.
CVE-2019-8980	2019-02-21	2021-06-02	7.8	0.99%			A memory leak in the kernel_read_file function in fs/exec.c in the Linux kernel through 4.20.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering vfs_read failures.
CVE-2019-8956	2019-04-01	2023-02-24	7.8	0.05%			In the Linux Kernel before versions 4.20.8 and 4.19.21 a use-after-free error in the "sctp_sendmsg()" function (net/sctp/socket.c) when handling SCTP_SENDALL flag can be exploited to corrupt memory.
CVE-2019-8912	2019-02-18	2021-06-02	7.8	0.05%			In the Linux kernel through 4.20.11, af_alg_release() in crypto/af_alg.c neglects to set a NULL value for a certain structure member, which leads to a use-after-free in sockfs_setattr.
CVE-2019-7308	2019-02-01	2019-09-24	5.6	0.05%			kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel before 4.20.6 performs undesirable out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic in various cases, including cases of different branches with different state or limits to sanitize, leading to side-channel attacks.
CVE-2019-7222	2019-03-21	2023-02-28	5.5	0.06%			The KVM implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.20.5 has an Information Leak.
CVE-2019-7221	2019-03-21	2020-10-15	7.8	0.09%			The KVM implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.20.5 has a Use-after-Free.
CVE-2019-6974	2019-02-15	2023-05-16	8.1	5.09%			In the Linux kernel before 4.20.8, kvm_ioctl_create_device in virt/kvm/kvm_main.c mishandles reference counting because of a race condition, leading to a use-after-free.
CVE-2019-5489	2019-01-07	2020-08-24	5.5	0.04%			The mincore() implementation in mm/mincore.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.13 allowed local attackers to observe page cache access patterns of other processes on the same system, potentially allowing sniffing of secret information. (Fixing this affects the output of the fincore program.) Limited remote exploitation may be possible, as demonstrated by latency differences in accessing public files from an Apache HTTP Server.
CVE-2019-5108	2019-12-23	2022-06-17	7.4	0.12%			An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel prior to mainline 5.3. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by triggering AP to send IAPP location updates for stations before the required authentication process has completed. This could lead to different denial-of-service scenarios, either by causing CAM table attacks, or by leading to traffic flapping if faking already existing clients in other nearby APs of the same wireless infrastructure. An attacker can forge Authentication and Association Request packets to trigger this vulnerability.
CVE-2019-3901	2019-04-22	2023-02-12	5.6	0.04%			A race condition in perf_event_open() allows local attackers to leak sensitive data from setuid programs. As no relevant locks (in particular the cred_guard_mutex) are held during the ptrace_may_access() call, it is possible for the specified target task to perform an execve() syscall with setuid execution before perf_event_alloc() actually attaches to it, allowing an attacker to bypass the ptrace_may_access() check and the perf_event_exit_task(current) call that is performed in install_exec_creds() during privileged execve() calls. This issue affects kernel versions before 4.8.
CVE-2019-3900	2019-04-25	2023-02-12	7.7	0.23%			An infinite loop issue was found in the vhost_net kernel module in Linux Kernel up to and including v5.1-rc6, while handling incoming packets in handle_rx(). It could occur if one end sends packets faster than the other end can process them. A guest user, maybe remote one, could use this flaw to stall the vhost_net kernel thread, resulting in a DoS scenario.
CVE-2019-3896	2019-06-19	2023-02-12	7.8	0.04%			A double-free can happen in idr_remove_all() in lib/idr.c in the Linux kernel 2.6 branch. An unprivileged local attacker can use this flaw for a privilege escalation or for a system crash and a denial of service (DoS).
CVE-2019-3887	2019-04-09	2023-02-12	6.7	0.05%			A flaw was found in the way KVM hypervisor handled x2APIC Machine Specific Rregister (MSR) access with nested(=1) virtualization enabled. In that, L1 guest could access L0's APIC register values via L2 guest, when 'virtualize x2APIC mode' is enabled. A guest could use this flaw to potentially crash the host kernel resulting in DoS issue. Kernel versions from 4.16 and newer are vulnerable to this issue.
CVE-2019-3882	2019-04-24	2023-02-12	5.5	0.04%			A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's vfio interface implementation that permits violation of the user's locked memory limit. If a device is bound to a vfio driver, such as vfio-pci, and the local attacker is administratively granted ownership of the device, it may cause a system memory exhaustion and thus a denial of service (DoS). Versions 3.10, 4.14 and 4.18 are vulnerable.
CVE-2019-3874	2019-03-25	2023-02-12	6.5	0.22%			The SCTP socket buffer used by a userspace application is not accounted by the cgroups subsystem. An attacker can use this flaw to cause a denial of service attack. Kernel 3.10.x and 4.18.x branches are believed to be vulnerable.
CVE-2019-3846	2019-06-03	2023-02-12	8.8	0.10%			A flaw that allowed an attacker to corrupt memory and possibly escalate privileges was found in the mwifiex kernel module while connecting to a malicious wireless network.
CVE-2019-3837	2019-04-11	2022-12-02	6.1	0.04%			It was found that the net_dma code in tcp_recvmsg() in the 2.6.32 kernel as shipped in RHEL6 is thread-unsafe. So an unprivileged multi-threaded userspace application calling recvmsg() for the same network socket in parallel executed on ioatdma-enabled hardware with net_dma enabled can leak the memory, crash the host leading to a denial-of-service or cause a random memory corruption.
CVE-2019-3819	2019-01-25	2020-10-19	4.9	0.04%			A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the function hid_debug_events_read() in drivers/hid/hid-debug.c file which may enter an infinite loop with certain parameters passed from a userspace. A local privileged user ("root") can cause a system lock up and a denial of service. Versions from v4.18 and newer are vulnerable.
CVE-2019-3701	2019-01-03	2019-09-03	4.9	0.07%			An issue was discovered in can_can_gw_rcv in net/can/gw.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.13. The CAN frame modification rules allow bitwise logical operations that can be also applied to the can_dlc field. The privileged user "root" with CAP_NET_ADMIN can create a CAN frame modification rule that makes the data length code a higher value than the available CAN frame data size. In combination with a configured checksum calculation where the result is stored relatively to the end of the data (e.g. cgw_csum_xor_rel) the tail of the skb (e.g. frag_list pointer in skb_shared_info) can be rewritten which finally can cause a system crash. Because of a missing check, the CAN drivers may write arbitrary content beyond the data registers in the CAN controller's I/O memory when processing can-gw manipulated outgoing frames.
CVE-2019-3460	2019-04-11	2022-04-22	6.5	0.12%			A heap data infoleak in multiple locations including L2CAP_PARSE_CONF_RSP was found in the Linux kernel before 5.1-rc1.
CVE-2019-3459	2019-04-11	2022-04-22	6.5	0.12%			A heap address information leak while using L2CAP_GET_CONF_OPT was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.1-rc1.

CVE-2018-19985	2019-03-21	2019-09-03	4.6	0.16%			The function hso_get_config_data in drivers/net/usb/hso.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.8 reads if_num from the USB device (as a u8) and uses it to index a small array, resulting in an object out-of-bounds (OOB) read that potentially allows arbitrary read in the kernel address space.
CVE-2018-16885	2019-01-03	2023-02-13	5.5	0.04%			A flaw was found in the Linux kernel that allows the userspace to call memcpy_fromiovecend() and similar functions with a zero offset and buffer length which causes the read beyond the buffer boundaries, in certain cases causing a memory access fault and a system halt by accessing invalid memory address. This issue only affects kernel version 3.10.x as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
CVE-2018-16882	2019-01-03	2023-01-19	8.8	0.05%			A use-after-free issue was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor processed posted interrupts when nested(=1) virtualization is enabled. In nested_get_vmcs12_pages(), in case of an error while processing posted interrupt address, it unmaps the 'pi_desc_page' without resetting 'pi_desc' descriptor address, which is later used in pi_test_and_clear_on(). A guest user/process could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS or potentially gain privileged access to a system. Kernel versions before 4.14.91 and before 4.19.13 are vulnerable.
CVE-2018-16880	2019-01-29	2023-07-19	7.0	0.05%			A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handle_rx() function in the [vhost_net] driver. A malicious virtual guest, under specific conditions, can trigger an out-of-bounds write in a kmalloc-8 slab on a virtual host which may lead to a kernel memory corruption and a system panic. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out. Versions from v4.16 and newer are vulnerable.
CVE-2018-16871	2019-07-30	2023-02-12	7.5	0.78%			A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's NFS implementation, all versions 3.x and all versions 4.x up to 4.20. An attacker, who is able to mount an exported NFS filesystem, is able to trigger a null pointer dereference by using an invalid NFS sequence. This can panic the machine and deny access to the NFS server. Any outstanding disk writes to the NFS server will be lost.
CVE-2018-7191	2019-05-17	2019-05-31	5.5	0.04%			In the tun subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.13.14, dev_get_valid_name is not called before register_netdevice. This allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic) via an ioctl(TUNSETIFF) call with a dev name containing a / character. This is similar to CVE-2013-4343.
CVE-2017-18595	2019-09-04	2023-02-23	7.8	0.04%			An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.14.11. A double free may be caused by the function allocate_trace_buffer in the file kernel/trace/trace.c.
CVE-2017-18552	2019-08-19	2019-10-07	7.8	0.04%			An issue was discovered in net/rds/af_rds.c in the Linux kernel before 4.11. There is an out of bounds write and read in the function rds_recv_track_latency.
CVE-2017-18551	2019-08-19	2020-05-04	6.7	0.05%			An issue was discovered in drivers/i2c/i2c-core-smbus.c in the Linux kernel before 4.14.15. There is an out of bounds write in the function i2c_smbus_xfer_emulated.
CVE-2017-18550	2019-08-19	2019-08-23	5.5	0.04%			An issue was discovered in drivers/scsi/aacraid/commctrl.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13. There is potential exposure of kernel stack memory because aac_get_hba_info does not initialize the hbainfo structure.
CVE-2017-18549	2019-08-19	2019-08-23	5.5	0.04%			An issue was discovered in drivers/scsi/aacraid/commctrl.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13. There is potential exposure of kernel stack memory because aac_send_raw_srb does not initialize the reply structure.
CVE-2017-18509	2019-08-13	2023-02-07	7.8	0.20%			An issue was discovered in net/ipv6/ip6mr.c in the Linux kernel before 4.11. By setting a specific socket option, an attacker can control a pointer in kernel land and cause an inet_csk_listen_stop general protection fault, or potentially execute arbitrary code under certain circumstances. The issue can be triggered as root (e.g., inside a default LXC container or with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability) or after namespace unsharing. This occurs because sk_type and protocol are not checked in the appropriate part of the ip6_mroute_* functions. NOTE: this affects Linux distributions that use 4.9.x longterm kernels before 4.9.187.
CVE-2017-18379	2019-07-27	2023-01-17	9.8	0.39%			In the Linux kernel before 4.14, an out of boundary access happened in drivers/nvme/target/fc.c.
CVE-2017-18360	2019-01-31	2019-04-17	5.5	0.04%			In change_port_settings in drivers/usb/serial/io_ti.c in the Linux kernel before 4.11.3, local users could cause a denial of service by division-by-zero in the serial device layer by trying to set very high baud rates.
CVE-2016-10907	2019-08-19	2019-10-07	7.8	0.04%			An issue was discovered in drivers/iio/dac/ad5755.c in the Linux kernel before 4.8.6. There is an out of bounds write in the function ad5755_parse_dt.
CVE-2016-10906	2019-08-19	2019-10-15	7.0	0.05%			An issue was discovered in drivers/net/ethernet/arc/emac_main.c in the Linux kernel before 4.5. A use-after-free is caused by a race condition between the functions arc_emac_tx and arc_emac_tx_clean.
CVE-2016-10905	2019-08-19	2023-08-11	7.8	0.05%			An issue was discovered in fs/gfs2/rgrp.c in the Linux kernel before 4.8. A use-after-free is caused by the functions gfs2_clear_rgrpd and read_rindex_entry.
CVE-2016-10764	2019-07-27	2023-01-19	9.8	0.47%			In the Linux kernel before 4.9.6, there is an off by one in the drivers/mtd/spi-nor/cadence-quadspi.c cqspi_setup_flash() function. There are CQSPI_MAX_CHIPSELECT elements in the ->f_pdata array so the ">" should be ">=" instead.
CVE-2016-10741	2019-02-01	2019-04-18	4.7	0.04%			In the Linux kernel before 4.9.3, fs/xfs/xfs_aops.c allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) because there is a race condition between direct and memory-mapped I/O (associated with a hole) that is handled with BUG_ON instead of an I/O failure.
CVE-2015-9289	2019-07-27	2019-12-11	5.5	0.05%			In the Linux kernel before 4.1.4, a buffer overflow occurs when checking userspace params in drivers/media/dvb-frontends/cx24116.c. The maximum size for a DiSEqC command is 6, according to the userspace API. However, the code allows larger values such as 23.
CVE-2014-3180	2019-11-06	2019-11-08	9.1	0.13%			** DISPUTED ** In kernel/compat.c in the Linux kernel before 3.17, as used in Google Chrome OS and other products, there is a possible out-of-bounds read. restart_syscall uses uninitialized data when restarting compat_sys_nanosleep. NOTE: this is disputed because the code path is unreachable.
CVE-2013-7470	2019-04-23	2021-11-17	7.1	0.34%			cipso_v4_validate in include/net/cipso_ipv4.h in the Linux kernel before 3.11.7, when CONFIG_NETLABEL is disabled, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and crash), as demonstrated by icmpsic, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-0310.
CVE-2012-6712	2019-07-27	2022-11-03	9.8	0.66%			In the Linux kernel before 3.4, a buffer overflow occurs in drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl-agn-sta.c, which will cause at least memory corruption.
CVE-2011-5327	2019-07-27	2022-11-03	9.8	0.50%			In the Linux kernel before 3.1, an off by one in the drivers/target/loopback/tcm_loop.c tcm_loop_make_naa_tpg() function could result in at least memory corruption.
CVE-2011-1474	2019-12-26	2020-01-10	5.5	0.04%			A locally locally exploitable DOS vulnerability was found in pax-linux versions 2.6.32.33-test79.patch, 2.6.38-test3.patch, and 2.6.37.4-test14.patch. A bad bounds check in arch_get_unmapped_area_topdown triggered by programs doing an mmap after a MAP_GROWSDOWN mmap will create an infinite loop condition without releasing the VM semaphore eventually leading to a system crash.
CVE-2010-5332	2019-07-27	2020-02-18	5.6	0.05%			In the Linux kernel before 2.6.37, an out of bounds array access happened in drivers/net/mlx4/port.c. When searching for a free entry in either mlx4_register_vlan() or mlx4_register_mac(), and there is no free entry, the loop terminates without updating the local variable free thus causing out of array bounds access.
CVE-2010-5331	2019-07-27	2023-03-03	7.8	0.05%			** DISPUTED ** In the Linux kernel before 2.6.34, a range check issue in drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/atombios.c could cause an off by one (buffer overflow) problem. NOTE: At least one Linux maintainer believes that this CVE is incorrectly assigned and should be rejected because the value is hard coded and are not user-controllable where it is used.
CVE-2010-2243	2019-11-07	2019-11-22	7.8	0.22%			A vulnerability exists in kernel/time/clocksource.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.34 where on non-GENERIC_TIME systems (GENERIC_TIME=n), accessing /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource results in an OOPS.
CVE-2007-6762	2019-07-27	2019-09-27	9.8	0.78%			In the Linux kernel before 2.6.20, there is an off-by-one bug in net/netlabel/netlabel_cipso_v4.c where it is possible to overflow the doi_def->tags[] array.
CVE-2007-3732	2019-11-07	2019-11-12	5.5	0.04%			In Linux 2.6 before 2.6.23, the TRACE_IRQS_ON function in iret_exc calls a C function without ensuring that the segments are set properly. The kernel's %fs needs to be restored before the call in TRACE_IRQS_ON and before enabling interrupts, so that "current" references work. Without this, "current" used in the window between iret_exc and the middle of error_code where %fs is reset, would crash.
